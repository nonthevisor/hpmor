"Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind's running in all different directions?" she managed.

"My own approach is usually to identify the different desires, give them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco, Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad, Mum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter."

Hermione considered trying this before her Common Sense warned that it might be a dangerous sort of thing to pretend. "There's a copy of me inside your head?"

"Of course there is!" Harry said. The boy suddenly looked a bit more vulnerable. "You mean there isn't a copy of me living in your head?"

  HPMOR comes from the world of fan-fiction. With J.~K.~Rowling’s approval, it tells the story of an alternate Harry, an auto-didact rationalist who brings all his powers to bear on the strange new vistas of the world of magic.

  \bigskip The books introduce the reader to the ways of thinking Yudkowsky lays out in his blog, \url{lesswrong.com}.}}
