Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no time for doubts, for caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the first thoughts and run with them

In the back of Harry's mind, fragments of abstract thought flitted past, heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time to rehearse in words. In wordless flashes they shot past, to set up the object-level problem.

\textit{- the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect of the situation seems most improbable}

\textit{- simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate improbabilities that must be postulated -}

\textit{- what do I notice I am confused by -}

  HPMOR comes from the world of fan-fiction. With J.~K.~Rowling’s approval, it tells the story of an alternate Harry, an auto-didact rationalist who brings all his powers to bear on the strange new vistas of the world of magic.

  \bigskip The books introduce the reader to the ways of thinking Yudkowsky lays out in his blog, \url{lesswrong.com}.}}
